<p>Whenever people think of football, they think of concussions. Unfortunately, that is just the nature of the game. One can’t expect two grown men running full speed and colliding into each other not to leave a mark.</p>
<p>To begin, it is important to really define what this affliction is. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head that causes the skull and brain to move rapidly back and forth.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of different avenues to work off of when dissecting concussion data. First, there is the positional side. What position is most affected by brain injuries? It is evident that, from 2019-2022, cornerbacks led the league with 61. This was five more than the next closest, which was wide receivers. There is an 11 player margin between corners and the third place spot, safeties, thus signifying that members of the secondary are at a far greater risk.</p>

<p>“When cornerbacks are involved in tackles, it's usually a situation where they're out in space, kind of one-on-one and usually asked to tackle a much bigger player,” explained Brandon Boyd, Education Programs Director at the Concussion Legacy Foundation. “So in those situations, especially if they’re tackling a running back, they might be forced to use their head as a way to make that tackle.”</p>
<p>Again, it goes back to that unavoidable aspect of the game. If you want to save a touchdown and help your team win, you’re going to need to put your body on the line. Regardless of the inevitability of brain injuries, it is paramount to have proper protocol. </p>
<p>A moment that stands out, particularly to Boyd, is an incident that occurred earlier this year with Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. After getting pushed to the ground, the 24-year-old’s head aggressively flew back and hit the turf. He then proceeded to grab the side of his head, which is a sign of a concussion. Next, he stood up and shook his head, which is another sign of a concussion. The worst part was when the third-year veteran almost collapsed due to balance and stability issues. Believe it or not, Tagovailoa came back in the second half and finished the game.</p>

    <p>Just a few days later, the captain was back on the field to play Thursday night. However, upon getting sacked, he exhibited decorticate posturing in his fingers as a trauma response. This scary string of events ignited a further discussion into diagnostic conduct and how to prevent similar occurrences from happening in the future. As a matter of fact, the NFL quickly adopted a stricter policy towards those showing signs of gross motor instability like Tagovailoa did the first time around.</p>
    <p>While everyone has a distinct way that their body responds to concussions, this situation brings into question how a player displaying such severe signs of impairment remained in the game and then suited up the next week. Subsequently, some might wonder how often one plays professional football less than seven days after suffering a brain injury.</p>
    <iframe title="How Many Weeks Are NFL Players Missing? " aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-FvIVw" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FvIVw/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="607" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
  <p>In looking at the data, 67 NFL athletes participated in the week following their diagnosis. That is second most behind those who sat out one game, which is 195. As the stints increase, the amount of players who are inactive decrease. There are no more than two guys who were out for seven weeks or longer. It’s great that there are not enough severe injuries to warrant prolonged absences, but it is still imperative to be cautious.</p>
  <p>Boyd expressed the risk of not being careful enough. Commonly, they would have to deal with persistent post-concussion symptoms where ailments can last up to six weeks or longer. There is already enough damage to the brain and reaggravation obviously makes it harder to heal. Furthermore, there is the very rare possibility of Second Impact Syndrome. This condition occurs when you suffer another concussion, which causes your brain to start swelling. In order to alleviate the inflammation, doctors have to remove a chunk of your skull. Overall, the operation has about a 50% morbidity rate.</p>
  <p>With recurring forceful impacts, comes the unfortunate likelihood of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, also known as CTE. Now at the forefront of conversation, it is a fatal and degenerative brain disease sparked by repeated head trauma. It is extremely prevalent in NFL players, with a study showing that 110 in 111 retirees have the condition.</p>
  <p>Despite all the controversy, the NFL concussion numbers have consistently been on the decline. The league appears to be taking a serious approach to prevent brain injuries. Going forward, there still remains a tremendous opportunity to fight the stigma and protect every player as best as possible.</p>

  <p>Given that there is no direct cure for CTE, Boyd and his colleagues are working to limit some of its root causes.</p>
  <p>“We’re trying to promote this idea that kids don't have to play football before they're in high school to reduce the amount of total hits to the head that they take over their life.”</p>
